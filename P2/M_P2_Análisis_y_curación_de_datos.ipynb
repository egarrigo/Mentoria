La misma se encuentra en constante aumento y en Córdoba son más del 50% las personas que presentan exceso de peso, y un 25% del total obesidad. Si bien se piensa que los principales factores que influyen en su desarrollo, son un nivel de actividad física inadecuado, el sedentarismo y una alimentación poco saludable, pueden existir otros determinantes de esta condición que deban ser considerados. Sin embargo, muchas veces es difícil contar con todos estos datos y analizarlos de manera conjunta  o considerando su efecto sinérgico.\n","Por otra parte, al conocer los aspectos que más influyen en la ocurrencia de esta enfermedad se podría abordar de manera integral y ofrecer a la población información, realizar recomendaciones y utilizar estos resultados para implementar políticas públicas para enfrentar la pandemia de la obesidad.\n","Así, en esta mentoría poneo a dispoición un dataset que tiene una numerosa variedad de features las cuales permitirán poder seleccionar aquellos que sean los mejores predictores para la enfermedad. También identificar patrones de alimentación y subgrupos de sujetos que compartan ciertas características, y de esta forma descubrir nuevos insights para desarrollar.   \n","Además, resulta interesante desarrollar metodologías para analizar y describir este problema, las que pueden ser replicadas en otros de las Ciencias de la salud y en el que se utilicen principalmente las herramientas que la Ciencia de Datos provee.\n","Esperamos que en esta mentoría puedas desarrollar y aplicar todas las herramientas y skills aprendidas durante el cursado de la diplomatura. Te proponemos objetivos específicos para la resolución de cada práctico poniendo en juego tus conocimientos y creatividad, y quién te dice encontras tu lado Abby Sciuto/John Snow. \n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"KzsI1LyHONx4"},"source":["##Motivación\n","❖\t¿Cuáles son las principales características de la población de Córdoba en cuanto a sus determinantes bio-socio-económicos?\n","\n","❖\t¿Es la obesidad una enfermedad que depende meramente de la alimentación de los sujetos?\n","\n","❖\t¿Cuáles son los factores alimentarios que promueven el desarrollo de la enfermedad?¿Y cuáles son aquellos que protegen?\n","\n","❖\t¿Se encuentra la obesidad asociada a la enfermedad cardiovascular?¿y al cáncer?\n","\n","❖\t¿Qué variables ayudarían a predecir el estado nutricional de un sujeto de la población de Córdoba?\n","\n","❖\t¿Cuáles son las características más visibles de los grupos según su estado nutricional?¿Existen características comunes que nos permitan predecir el estado nutricional que tendrá una persona?\n","\n","❖\t¿Existe algún patrón alimentario característico por grupos según la presencia o no de obesidad?\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"colab_type":"text","id":"mIzmOT_eOtAh"},"source":["##Conociendo el dataset...\n","Nuestra base de datos cuenta con 4292 observaciones y 239 variables.
